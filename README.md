# Frenetic neural networks

This project contains the code of the implementations of the algorithms described in the paper 'Pattern recognition in a nonequilibrium graph'.

The starting point for the implementation of the algorithm for disentangling the basins of attraction is in the file step_1/find_exuberant_system.py

The starting point for the implementation of Moon's algorithm is in the file step_1/find_cycle.py

The starting point for the implementation of Manoussakis's algorithm is in the file step_1/find_hamilton_cycle.py

The starting point for the implementation of the algorithm for frenetic steering is in the file step_2/execute_learning_step/algorithm_3/algorithm_3.py
